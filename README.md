# Learning C
 
This is a repository of my C exercises to remember the C programming language, I will personally include some fun side projects to learn the language once more or in all reality just to remember how to use it in the first place.

Oh yeah, I shoud also note that this process will be slow since I am reading a book on the subject and I cannot exactly speedrun the book if I want to get optimal results from the learning experience
